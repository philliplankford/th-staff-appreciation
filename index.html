                        We met as students in the beta FEWD Techdegree.<br>
                        You reached out to me via DM in the Slack channels when I posted a question for my project 4 (Photo Gallery) and you gave me lots of support and encouragement. &#128512;<br> You were already showing what an excellent moderator and then student success specialist you would become.<br> It has been mainly you who built up my courage, confidence, and dev skills over these four years.<br> Thank you for being a great friend, mentor and awesome person. I feel very lucky and blessed to have met you and that you are part of my dev journey. I will miss you beyond words. &#128151;</p>
                        <p><strong>Amber:</strong>
                            Even before you became a student success specialist on our Techdegree, you were already supporting and encouraging me via Twitter and my 100DaysOfCode posts.<br> So I have to tell you when you asked if it was me on Twitter and said that you had been following me. My jaw hit the floor, &#128558;, and I felt deeply honoured that I had a follower of such high calibre as a dev.<br> Not to mention the respect I have that as a mother, you have managed to complete several TDs. As a mum myself, you have given me the confidence that mums can be devs too! You have been inspirational to me in so many ways.<br> Thank you for being such a caring, supportive and inspiring lady to me. I will miss you but hope to at least stay connected on Twitter &#128540; &#128151;
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Sarah:</strong>
                            Wow, it has been too short a time with you. &#128546; I felt blessed that we had another rock star lady supporting us. Thank you for always giving me back up on the Trello boards. &#128514;<br>
                            Without fail, you always thanked everyone who supported the Slack channels over the weekends when you didn't have to.<br>
                            However, the one personal thing I would like to thank you for is the great advice about local storage for my project 7 you gave me. Like Brian and Amber you were caring, supportive and inspiring to us all. Thank you &#128151;<br></p>

                            I feel very fortunate to have not only been given a scholarship to the Treehouse Tech Degree during lockdown, but to have been helped along the way by the awesome staff.                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I genuinely don't think I would know half of what I know without Brain, for who no question was to silly, even now.

                        <p>
                            Working alongside Brain, Amber and Sarah, using the knowledge I have gained from them has been an honor and a privilege. Being able to put this to use in helping other students has been a great experience, which I will hold dear for a long time to come. I am so sad this time is coming to an end.
                        </p>

                            I wish all 3 the best of luck, I know there are bigger and better opportunities in the future. Treehouse will not be the same without each of you.

                            Over the years I've tried to get into programming multiple times but failed due to imposter syndrome and a lack of dedication. This changed completely when starting the FEWD Techdegree and joining its amazing Slack community. I felt right at home! The support and encouragements were exactly what I needed to stick to it and overcome the obstacles that threw me down previously. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After the first couple of projects and trying to help some fellow peers I was given the opportunity to become a Slack Champ. I still remember the day Brian send me that DM, I was so happy and proud! The amazing SSS / Moderator / Champ team I became part of gave me even more motivation to keep pushing. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Over the years we've seen multiple team members take on new jobs but the team spirit was always kept alive / enforced with Amber and Sarah joining the team. I'll be forever grateful to you all and I feel privileged to have been part of this amazing group of developers. Each of you helped make me the dev I am today, I couldn't have done this without your amazing support!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Thank you Brian, Amber and Sarah for the amazing support you've provided, the great fun, motivation, inspiration and for generally being AWESOME! I wish you all the best in the future and I'm sure that where one door closes another opens. Any company should be lucky to have you 💚

                            When I started the FEWD techdegree a few years ago, I was a shy, somewhat over 50 year old woman, who wasn't comfortable sharing her thoughts in English, doubting everything about her knowledge and feeling incapable and awkward around people who always seemed to know everything - I just had the feeling I never would make it further than maybe the first two projects.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Well, the awesome people who where in this community proved me to be completely wrong! At that time, Randy, Brian, Nicole and Athena were the SSS, and they - complete strangers at this time - gave me motivation and self-esteem - enough, to bring me to engage within this amazing community and become a part of it. The day Randy asked me if I wanted to become a slack-champion - I'll never forget the joy I felt!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Over the years, other Student Success Specialists came and left, but I'll never forget one single of them. I'm devastated to see leaving the current team all at once - it feels like losing a family.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This current team was absolutely amazing! You helped us grow and believe in our selfs. Thanks for everything, Brian, Amber and Sarah! You did an amazing job helping all our peers realize their dreams and grow beyond themselves.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Best of luck for your future! May your terrific work you've done here be a stepping stone to the job of your dreams! I wish you only the best - you all deserve nothing less!

                            When I decided to take on the tech degree I wasn't sure how I would do. The course seemed to cover so much. Although the teachers and videos were great learning tools, it was your guidance, support, and encouragement that really gave me the confidence and knowledge to progress.

                            I’ve learnt so much from you about how to handle challenging questions, how to provide feedback in a positive and enabling way, and obviously so much about coding! Also, never have I seen such excellent emoji selections.
